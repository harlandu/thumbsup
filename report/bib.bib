Focusing primarily on the AdaBoost algorithm, this  chapter overviews some of the recent work on boosting including analyses  of AdaBoost\&\#039;s training error and generalization error; boosting\&\#039;s connection  to game theory and linear programming; the relationship between boosting  and logistic regression; extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass classification  problems; methods of incorporating human knowledge into boosting; and  experimental and applied work using boosting.}},
